# **LuaPlusPlus tutorial**

1. Put the Lua++ dll (https://github.com/D3ftsu/LeaguePlusPlus/blob/master/LuaPlusPlus/Release/LuaPlusPlus.dll?raw=true) into your L++ plugin's folder and select it in game, it will automaticly create folders for you. Your L++ folder should look like this : https://i.gyazo.com/0510242ce02f3457749cf73dde222505.png
2. Put the .lua scripts inside [L++ Dir]/LuaPlusPlus/Scripts, when you reload your LuaPlusPlus plugin and you have atleast 1 script in your scripts folder you should have a menu like this : https://i.gyazo.com/806435987b54c5ab5c84a6c4c9f456d2.png (ofcourse it depends on the scripts you got on your folder)
3. Select the scripts you want from your Lua++ Menu and Load (using F5), the engine is always off by default so you could select what do you want then load them.
4. Profit?

# **HotKeys**
1. F5 = Load
2. F6 = Unload

# **TODO**
1. API documentation (obviously..)
2. Add Constants (Buff Type, TS Type, CollisionType, etc..)
3. Fix Overloaded functions (IssueOrder/ShowPing/SendPing etc..)
